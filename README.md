# Archlinux
advance GUI Condiguration backup

1.XTERM
  .Xresources configuration  clear fonts,solarized,powerline supported(install powerline fonts);
  After this, it's beautiful than any other terminal emulator!!!!Cause it has no menu or configure bar...
  
  But,clip_board has a problem.short_key about ctrl+shift+c(copy)  ctrl+shift+v(paste)
  
  
2.i3wm
  this is a fancy tilling windows manager.easy learn ,easy to use.simple configuration add into config file
  
3.herbstlufwm
  Oooooops,this is amazing! i have to use xterm(lazy guy,Why don't you just use konsole or terminator?) 


i spent some day on comfiguring my archlinux.So keep a backup   -_-!
